    "# Homeward: AI-Powered missing persons finder\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è !! Go to the linked GitHub project for the full demo !! ‚ö†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype showcases just an interactive demo of what the web application available on GitHub provides, please check the full project on the attached repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lost in a sea of unstructured data\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, thousands of people go missing, and law enforcement agencies face a daunting challenge: **analyzing vast amounts of unstructured surveillance data** spread across multiple formats, locations, and timeframes. Traditional approaches require manual review of countless hours of video footage, photographs, and witness reports - a time-consuming process that can mean the difference between life and death.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How BigQuery + Gemini can make the difference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homeward** demonstrates how BigQuery's AI capabilities can transform this critical real-world problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† **AI-Powered Content Analysis**: Using Google's Gemini multimodal models to automatically analyze surveillance footage and identify potential matches against missing persons reports and sightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìä **Pattern Recognition at Scale**: Leveraging BigQuery's analytical power to find temporal and spatial patterns across data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç **Semantic Search**: Enabling natural language queries against unstructured video content and image data, by leveraging embedding and Vector Search within BigQuery to search missing persons and sightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll see in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll walk through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up the GCP resources** - Creating datasets, external tables, and AI connections\n",
    "2. **Missing persons case management** - Create and summarize (through Gemini) missing persons reports\n",
    "4. **Sighting report management** - Create and summarize (through Gemini) sightings\n",
    "4. **Semantic search** - Find missing persons reports starting from sightings and vice-versa through vector search in BigQuery.\n",
    "3. **AI-Powered Video Analysis** - Using Gemini to analyze surveillance footage to find potential matches with missing persons reports\n",
    "5. **Environment cleanup** - Destroy the GCP resources created for this demo\n",

      "This is a high-priority, time-sensitive analysis.\n",
      "The provided video is a low-quality security footage from the street, where people are walking around.\n",
      "The objective is to determine if the missing person is visible in this video, and if so, to extract all relevant information about their presence.\n",

      "1.  **Full Video Scan:** Meticulously review the entire video from start to finish. Do not stop after a potential first match; the person may appear multiple times.\n",
      "2.  **Feature Matching:** Compare every individual in the video against the `MISSING PERSON DATA`. Assess matches based on all available criteria: clothing, build, hair, accessories, and any visible distinguishing features or mannerisms.\n",
      "3.  **Justification:** You MUST provide a step-by-step justification for your match. List the features that matched, the features that did not match, and any features that were ambiguous or obscured (e.g., 'Face was unclear, but clothing is a 90% match').\n",
      "4.  **Contextual Analysis (If Found):** If you identify the person with confidence:\n",
      "    -   Note the exact timestamp(s) (in `HH:MM:SS` format) of their appearance.\n",
      "    -   Describe their actions and behavior (e.g., 'walking quickly', 'talking on the phone', 'sitting on a bench', 'seemed distressed').\n",
      "    -   Analyze if they are with anyone else. If so, provide a detailed description of each companion (gender, estimated age, clothing, etc.).\n",
      "    -   Describe their direction of travel.\n",
      "5. **Confidence Score (If Found):** If you identify a person with confidence:\n",
