# Homeward: AI-Powered missing persons finder

**ü•Ω This repo contains my submission for the [BigQuery AI Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bigquery-ai-hackathon)**

![Homeward Logo](docs/img/homeward_logo.png)

## Overview

**Homeward** is an innovative missing persons finder application that leverages the power of Google Cloud Platform's AI capabilities to help law enforcement agencies locate missing individuals through video surveillance analysis and semantic matching between case reports and sightings.

The primary goals and objectives of the Homeward application are:

* **Accelerate search operations**: Significantly reduce the time required to find a missing person by automating the analysis of video footage and the matching of case reports and sightings.
* **Improve investigation accuracy**: Leverage AI to identify potential sightings and connections that might be missed by human operators.
* **Centralize case information**: Provide a single, unified platform for registering missing persons, logging sightings, and managing all related case data.

The primary users of this application are:

* **Law enforcement officers**: Police officers and detectives directly responsible for investigating missing person cases.
* **Government agency personnel**: Staff from national or regional centers for missing persons who are involved in the coordination and management of these cases.

## üéØ Hackathon Highlights

This submission showcases several innovative features of BigQuery:

1. **Object tables for Video processing**: Utilizing BigQuery's object tables to create external references to video files in Cloud Storage
2. **Multimodal data analysis**: Analyzing video content through Gemini models for person detection and matching with just SQL.
3. **Object table metadata enrichment and filtering**: Using object metadata to filter-out unwanted files (time-filtering and geo-filtering) and let Gemini analyze only the needed files.
4. **Semantic matching**: Leveraging Gemini summarizations, embeddings and vector similarity to match cases with sightings.
5. **Semantic search**: Natural language queries for finding specific missing cases.

   ```

   **Optional: Include demo data**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh --project-id your-project-id --region us-central1 --demo-folder ./demo
   ```

   The setup script will:
   - Create necessary GCP resources (storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, connections)
   - Configure IAM permissions
   - Set up Gemini AI model endpoints
   - Populate demo data if specified

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uv run --env-file=.env python src/homeward/main.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

- `--project-id`: Google Cloud Project ID (required)
- `--region`: Google Cloud region (required, e.g., `us-central1`)
- `--demo-folder`: Path to demo data folder (optional)

## üéØ BigQuery AI Integration

### Object Tables

The project leverages BigQuery's object tables to create direct references to video files:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `project.dataset.video_objects`
OPTIONS (
  object_metadata = 'SIMPLE',
  max_staleness = INTERVAL 1 HOUR,
  metadata_cache_mode = 'AUTOMATIC'
);
```

### Gemini Model Integration

Videos are analyzed using Google's Gemini models through BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT ml_generate_text_llm_result
FROM ML.GENERATE_TEXT(
  MODEL `project.dataset.gemini_model`,
  TABLE `project.dataset.video_objects`,
  STRUCT(
    'Find a person matching this description: tall, wearing red jacket' AS prompt,
    TRUE AS FLATTEN_JSON_OUTPUT
  )
);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

Based on our development experience, we've identified several limitations with the current BigQuery AI integration:

### 1. Manual Cache Refresh Issues
- **Problem**: Manual cache refresh for object tables doesn't work as expected
- **Impact**: May require waiting for automatic cache refresh cycles
- **Workaround**: Use automatic cache refresh with appropriate `max_staleness` settings

### 2. ML.GENERATE_TEXT with Object Tables
- **Problem**: Direct use of `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` with object tables encounters issues with both global and regional endpoints
- **Impact**: Limits direct video analysis capabilities
- **Current Status**: Under investigation, may require alternative approaches

### 3. Object Table as Standard Table Treatment
- **Problem**: Treating object tables as standard tables in `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` queries fails
- **Impact**: Requires specific handling for video content analysis
- **Workaround**: Use object table-specific functions and configurations

For detailed technical information about these limitations, see `limitations.ipynb`.
