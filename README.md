2. **Multimodal data analysis**: Analyzing video content through Gemini models for person detection and matching with just SQL.
3. **Object table metadata enrichment and filtering**: Using object metadata to filter-out unwanted files (time-filtering and geo-filtering) and let Gemini analyze only the needed files.
4. **Semantic matching**: Leveraging Gemini summarizations, embeddings and vector similarity to match cases with sightings.
5. **Semantic search**: Natural language queries for finding specific missing cases.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
![Google Cloud Architecture](./docs/img/architecture.png "Google Cloud Architecture")

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend/Backend**: Python with NiceGUI framework
- **Database**: Google BigQuery
- **Object Storage**: Google Cloud Storage
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini multimodal models and Vertex AI embedding models

### Data Model

The application consists of the following core tables:

- **`missing_persons`**: Central registry of missing person cases with demographics, descriptions, and case metadata
- **`sightings`**: Individual sighting reports from various sources (manual reports, AI analysis)
- **`case_sightings`**: Junction table linking sightings to specific missing person cases
- **`video_objects`**: External table referencing video files in Cloud Storage with metadata
- **`video_analytics_results`**: AI analysis results from Gemini model processing

If you want to know more the `sql` folder contains the DDL and DML of the application.

### Core Features

#### Missing person case management

The application provides case management capabilities that enable law enforcement agencies to efficiently register and track missing person cases. Officers can input detailed missing person information through some forms that capture essential metadata, demographics, and case specifics. The system maintains a complete case timeline that tracks all related sightings and analysis results, providing investigators with a chronological view of case developments. Full CRUD operations allow users to create, read, update, and delete case information as investigations evolve, ensuring that case files remain current and accurate throughout the investigation process.

#### Sighting Management

The platform offers flexible sighting management that accommodates both manual and automated reporting mechanisms. Manual registration capabilities allow officers and citizens to report potential sightings from various sources, including tips from the public, officer observations, and other investigative leads. The system's automatic linking functionality intelligently connects AI-detected sightings to existing missing person cases, reducing manual workload and ensuring that no potential matches are overlooked during the investigation process.

#### Video Intelligence

Advanced video intelligence capabilities leverage AI-powered analysis to process surveillance footage. Geographic filtering allows investigators to select cameras by location and define search radius parameters, focusing analysis efforts on relevant geographic areas where the missing person was last seen or likely to be found. Temporal filtering enables the system to analyze videos within specific time ranges, optimizing processing resources and focusing on the most relevant timeframes. The AI generates confidence scores for potential matches, providing investigators with quantifiable assessments of match likelihood to prioritize their investigative efforts.

#### Semantic Search

The application incorporates semantic search capabilities that enable natural language querying of case databases. Using semantic matching technology, investigators can use natural language descriptions to identify and retrieve specific missing person cases, even when exact keyword matches are not available. This functionality allows for more intuitive and flexible case identification, enabling officers to find relevant cases based on descriptive characteristics and contextual information rather than rigid search parameters.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BigQuery AI Friction points

Based on our development experience, I've experienced the following limitations with BigQuery + Gemini:

### 1. Manual Cache Refresh Issues
- **Problem**: Manual cache refresh for object tables doesn't work as expected
- **Impact**: May require waiting for automatic cache refresh cycles
- **Workaround**: Use automatic cache refresh with appropriate `max_staleness` settings

### 2. ML.GENERATE_TEXT with Object Tables
- **Problem**: Direct use of `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` with object tables encounters issues with both global and regional endpoints
- **Impact**: Limits direct video analysis capabilities
- **Current Status**: Under investigation, may require alternative approaches

### 3. Object Table as Standard Table Treatment
- **Problem**: Treating object tables as standard tables in `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` queries fails
- **Impact**: Requires specific handling for video content analysis
- **Workaround**: Use object table-specific functions and configurations

For detailed technical information about these limitations, see `limitations.ipynb`.
